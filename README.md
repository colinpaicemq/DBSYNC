# DBSYNC
UpdatedRACF DBSYNC

## Updated 

The original IBM DBSYNC from 2012 is in https://public.dhe.ibm.com/eserver/zseries/zos/racf/dbsync/ , and I could find
no later updates to it.

I have taken it, and extened it to support newer functions and RACF changes.

The base documentation is [here](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/eserver/zseries/zos/racf/dbsync/dbsync.doc.txt) 
My updates are here
